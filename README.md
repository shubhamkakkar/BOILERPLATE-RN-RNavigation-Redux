# BOILERPLATE-RN-RNavigation-Redux-LocalPassport
We react native developers always feel it a redundant task to alwasy setup native code in android native files like mainActivity.java file,
and in Xcode as well ( But I am a Android React Native developer ), thus I have made a boilerplate application for the same.
features : 
<li>
  React Navigation setup 
    <ul>
      <li>  
        Bottombar Navigation 
      </li>
      <li>  
        Stack Navigation 
      </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Redux Configured
</li>
